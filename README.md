# Hanami ðŸŒ¸

a Discord bot written in TypeScript, using the Bun runtime engine.

I mainly wrote this bot for my friends, but a lot more people wanted to use it than I thought.

So now, we're here. Hopefully it meets your expectations.

If you're here to contribute/look at the code, welcome!

Although, the code is not very well documented, I tried my best!

Feel free to open up an issue/pull request at this [repository](https://github.com/yorunoken/HanamiBot)

## What does it do?

It's an osu! Discord bot. You can check your stats, recent plays, top plays, compare scores, get beatmap info, and a bunch of other stuff.

Link your osu! account with `/link` and you won't need to type your username every time.

Use `/help` to see all the commands.

## Invite the bot

[Add Hanami to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=995999045157916763&permissions=330752&scope=bot)

## Libraries

You can look at all of the libraries I use by going to `package.json` in the main branch, but mainly:

- [Lilybird](https://github.com/Didas-git/lilybird) to communicate with Discord's API.

- [osu-web.js](https://github.com/L-Mario564/osu.js) to communicate with osu!'s servers.

- [rosu-pp's JavaScript bind](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp-js) to calculate pp, bpm values, other technical stuff of osu!
