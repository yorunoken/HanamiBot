# Hanami üå∏

Hello! This is Hanami, a Discord bot written in TypeScript, using the Bun runtime engine.

I mainly wrote this bot for my friends, but after decided to expand it. (Like no one else has written an osu! Discord bot before, lol.)

---

So now, we're here. Hopefuly it meets your expectations.

If you're here to contribute/look at the code, welcome!

Although, the code is not very well documented, I tried my best!

Feel free to open up an issue/pull request over at the main [repository](https://github.com/YoruNoKen/HanamiBot)

Probably wasn't needed, but this project is licenced with [Apache version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses)!

## Main libraries I use

You can look at all of the libraries I use by going to `package.json` in the main branch, but mainly:

- [Lilybird](https://github.com/Didas-git/lilybird) to communicate with Discord's API.

- [osu-web.js](https://github.com/L-Mario564/osu.js) to communicate with osu!s servers.

- [rosu-pp's JavaScript bind](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp-js) to calculate pp, bpm values, other technical stuff of osu!

Invite the bot to your guild using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=995999045157916763&permissions=330752&scope=bot)

## Commands ‚≠ê

The bot will have lots of commands.

These are the bare-bone ones.

- `/osu` get a user's osu! profile

- `/recent` get a user's most recent osu! score

- `/top` get a user's osu! top plays

use `/help` in your guild for more information.
